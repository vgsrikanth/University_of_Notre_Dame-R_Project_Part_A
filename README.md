# University of Notre Dame - R Project - Part A

The goal of this project is to explore the relationship between education, income, and physical characteristics over a span of 25 years for subjects from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth of 1979. The Project is divided in to two parts. This is the first Part - Part A

Part A
The purpose of this assignment is to tidy and clean the height data for respondents to NLSY '79 for all available years. Tidying the data is necessary because a person's height is recorded with different variables for each survey year. In this form, it is cumbersome, for example, to plot trends in height for individual teens as they aged. For this dataset, "cleaning" the data will refer to identifying values that represent missing values, or values that appear to be erroneously recorded.

Please see the final PDF file - VISHNUVAJHALA_SRIKANTH_FPA.pdf for the final submission I did.
Please see the final R file - partA_tidy_height.R for the R code of this Project.
